### Integration of JSHint

Integrating JSHint into our development process involves setting it up locally for developers and configuring it within the CI/CD pipeline for automated syntax checks on pull requests. This end-to-end integration ensures syntax consistency and catches errors early, streamlining code quality checks from development through to deployment.

#### Step 1: Install JSHint

1. **Local Installation**:
   To start, install JSHint as a development dependency within your project. This allows developers to use JSHint locally before committing code.
   ```bash
   npm install jshint --save-dev
   ```

2. **Global Installation (Optional)**:
   Developers may also choose to install JSHint globally on their machines for quick syntax checking across multiple projects.
   ```bash
   npm install -g jshint
   ```

#### Step 2: Configure JSHint

1. **Create a Configuration File**:
   In the root directory of your project, create a `.jshintrc` file. This file will hold the project-specific settings that JSHint will follow during analysis.
   ```bash
   touch .jshintrc
   ```

2. **Customize the Configuration**:
   Inside `.jshintrc`, configure the rules to match your project’s needs. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "esversion": 9,             // Sets ECMAScript version 9 compatibility
     "node": true,               // Enables Node.js environment support
     "undef": true,              // Flags usage of undeclared variables
     "unused": true,             // Flags variables that are declared but not used
     "globals": {                // Defines project-specific global variables
       "describe": true,
       "it": true,
       "beforeEach": true,
       "jQuery": true,
       "fetch": true
     }
   }
   ```
   This configuration ensures JSHint aligns with your coding standards and reduces false positives on common globals.

#### Step 3: Add JSHint Script to `package.json`

To simplify running JSHint locally, add a script to your `package.json` file:
```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "jshint ."
}
```
Now, developers can run JSHint on their codebase by typing `npm run lint` in the command line. This script checks the project’s files for syntax errors before committing code.

#### Step 4: Integrate JSHint into CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Set Up GitHub Actions**:
   In your project’s GitHub repository, navigate to `.github/workflows` and create a new YAML file (e.g., `jshint.yml`) for GitHub Actions.

2. **Configure [JSHint Workflow](https://github.com/CMU-313/nodebb-f24-the-turtles/blob/f24/.github/workflows/jshint.yml)**:
   Set up the workflow to run on pull requests, automatically checking code quality before merging:
   ```yaml
   name: JSHint Lint Check

   on:
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     lint:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Run JSHint
           run: npm run lint
   ```
   This configuration ensures that JSHint automatically runs each time a pull request is made to the main branch. If JSHint flags any syntax issues, the action will fail, prompting developers to address the issues before the code can be merged.
