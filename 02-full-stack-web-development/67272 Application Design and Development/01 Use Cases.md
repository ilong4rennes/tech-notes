## Def

- Databases (what a system knows) 
- Use Cases (what a system does)
- A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements.

## Use case actors

- Complex actor: Any human actor interacting with a graphical user interface
- Average actor: Humans limited to read-only access 
- Simple Actor: If the system is interacting with an external API (such as Google Calendar, in this case)

## Use case levels
- A-level use cases are “must haves” — without it the system is of little or no value 
- B-level use cases are “want to have” — they make life much easier, but system is still usable 
- C-level use cases are “like to have” — nice, but could easily live without 
- Build functionality in order of priority; i.e., build out A-level functionality before working on B- or C-level cases
