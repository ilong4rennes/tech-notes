## Primacy of Mission

- Every well-run business, organization, and project requires a shared imagination. 
- This is what allows people to make complex decisions when there are no simple rules. 
- It keeps the group moving in concert. 
- When we’re talking about a shared result, we call it a vision. 
- When we’re talking about a shared understanding of what the organization does to achieve a result, we call it a mission statement.
- For you to be effective, you have to understand how technology can be used to support their mission. 
- Supporting their mission is the only reason for them to adopt any new technology.

## Structuring Unstructured Problems 

- The client’s ask is likely to be very unstructured.
- Your goal in the next couple weeks is to craft a proposal: 
	- a) A thorough description & analysis of the client’s context 
	- b) A detailed and clear Scope of Work. (I.e. What you are going to do.) 
- So you need to go 
	- from Request == unstructured 
	- to Scope of Work == structured
