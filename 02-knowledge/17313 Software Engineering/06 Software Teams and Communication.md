- **Running a (good) meeting**
	- The Three Rules of Running a Meeting 
		- Set the Agenda 
		- Start on Time. End on Time. 
		- End with Action Items (and share them - Github Issues, Meeting Notes, …)
	- Set and document clear responsibilities and expectations 
	- Make everyone contribute 
		- Possible Roles: Coordinator, Scribe, Checker 
		- Manage Personalities 
		- Be Vulnerable
	- Note takers have a lot of power to steer the meeting 
		- Collaborative notes are even better! 
	- Different meeting types have different best practices 
		- Decision-making meeting 
		- Brainstorming meeting 
		- One-on-one meeting 
		- Working sessions

- **Useful feedback** 
	- If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding; think before you react. 
	- Ask, don’t tell. (“What do you think about trying…?” rather than “Don’t do…”) 
	- Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in line with the style guide? A personal preference?) 
	- Be humble. (“I’m not sure, let’s try…”) 
	- Avoid hyperbole. (“NEVER do…”) 
	- Be aware of negative bias with online communication.

- **Knowledge Sharing**
	- Know your audience 
		- Internal document for your team (e.g., meeting note) 
		- Documentation for project contributors 
		- Documentation for non-developer collaborators (e.g., UX researchers) 
		- Documentation for developer users 
		- Documentation for clients with no software knowledge 
		- User manual for end users
