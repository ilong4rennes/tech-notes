- **Vasa Syndrome**:
	- A famous historical failure in shipbuilding is used as an analogy for software projects that suffer from unclear requirements, shifting specifications, and inadequate testing.
	- Requirements
		- Changing shipbuilding orders 
		- No specifications for modified keel 
		- Shifting armaments requirements
	- Teams
		- Shipwright’s death
	- Metrics
		- No way to calculate stability, stiffness, or sailing characteristics
	- Quality Assurance (QA): Testing, reviewing
		- Failed pre-launch stability tests

- **Complex software engineering issues**
	- Requirements (Architecture & Design)
		- **Software running with kernel-level privilege can crash the system (BSOD) and prevent booting**: High-privileged software can cause catastrophic system failures, like a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), making the system unusable.
		- **Content updates more continuous than software updates**: Continuous content updates outpaced the software's ability to accommodate them, introducing instability.
	- QA
		- **Insufficient testing of content _and_ parser**: Lack of thorough testing of both the content and the parsers (which interpret the content) allowed defects to go unnoticed.
	- DevOps
		- **No staged roll-outs**: The absence of gradual deployment of updates (staging) increased the risk of introducing wide-scale issues.
		- **No way to fix issue remotely after impact**: Once problems were introduced, there was no mechanism to resolve them remotely, leading to greater operational downtime.
	- Metrics
		- **Skewed incentives**: Misaligned goals or motivations across teams or stakeholders led to decisions that negatively impacted the product's quality or performance.
	- Licenses
		- **Limited liability**: A lack of accountability or liability limits may have discouraged sufficient quality assurance, leading to negligence in testing or development.

- **CrowdStrike Incident**:
	- A modern example of software engineering failure due to insufficient testing, lack of staged rollouts, and difficulty in addressing post-release issues remotely.
