### 21 Harold Kincaid *There are Laws in Social Science*

- **Challenge of Stability in Complex Phenomena:** Traditional science assumes stable patterns (laws), but in complex systems like social sciences, these patterns are rare due to multiple interacting causes and context-specific factors.
- **Redefining Laws:** Kincaid redefines "laws" as statements identifying causal factors, not universal regularities, emphasizing their role in explaining and predicting phenomena.
- **Focus on Causal Networks:** Instead of searching for universal laws, science should focus on understanding context-sensitive networks of causes, especially in social sciences.
- **Role of Idealizations and Abstractions:** Both natural and social sciences use simplified models and assumptions, which, despite being partially false, can still yield useful predictions and explanations.
- **Applicability Across Sciences:** Kincaid argues that focusing on causal factors over universal laws is relevant not just in social sciences but also in other fields dealing with complex systems.
- **Practical Implication:** Understanding causal mechanisms in context enhances scientific inquiry, moving beyond the limitations of universal, exceptionless laws.

### 22 Sandra D. Mitchell's _Through the Fractured Looking Glass_ 

- **Model Partiality**: All scientific models are inherently incomplete due to abstraction and idealization, and cannot fully represent nature.
- **Importance of Diverse Perspectives**: Science benefits from integrating multiple models and methods to gain a more accurate and holistic understanding.
- **Critique of Single Truth Models**: Challenges the "mirror-of-nature" assumption, emphasizing that no single model can entirely describe natural phenomena.
- **Integrative Pluralism**: Combining diverse, partial models provides complementary insights without needing to unify or reduce them to a single model.
- **Dynamic Nature of Science**: Science progresses through iterative processes, relying on diverse models and perspectives to refine understanding.
