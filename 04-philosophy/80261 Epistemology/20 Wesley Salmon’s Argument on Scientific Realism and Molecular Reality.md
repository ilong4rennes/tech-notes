#### **Context and Philosophical Background**

1. **Philosophical Debate on Realism:**
    - The question of whether unobservable entities (e.g., atoms) are real or just tools for organizing experience has been central to scientific philosophy.
    - Instrumentalism (e.g., by Mach and Carnap) suggests these entities are theoretical constructs, while scientific realism (e.g., by Reichenbach and Popper) argues for their objective reality.
2. **Salmon's Approach:**
    - Salmon supports realism using empirical observations and reasoning.
    - He emphasizes the "conjunctive fork" principle—when multiple independent methods agree on a result, it indicates a common cause, supporting the reality of unobservable entities like atoms.

#### **Historical Case of Avogadro’s Number**

1. **Perrin’s Work and Brownian Motion:**
    
    - Jean Perrin provided strong experimental evidence for the existence of atoms by calculating Avogadro's number using Brownian motion (random movement of particles in a fluid due to molecular interactions).
    - His methods involved precise observations of colloidal particles and comparisons across multiple independent experimental approaches.
2. **Agreement Across Methods:**
    
    - Perrin and other scientists derived Avogadro’s number using various methods:
        - **Brownian Motion:** Vertical distribution, translational, and rotational motion of particles.
        - **Alpha Decay:** Measuring helium nuclei produced by radioactive substances.
        - **X-Ray Diffraction:** Using crystal structures as diffraction gratings to estimate atomic spacing.
    - These methods, despite their diversity, converged on the same numerical value, reinforcing the atomic hypothesis.
3. **Impact of Perrin's Results:**
    
    - Perrin’s experiments convinced even skeptics, like Wilhelm Ostwald, to accept the reality of atoms.
    - The "remarkable agreement" across methods demonstrated the consistency and plausibility of atomic theory.

#### **Key Concepts in Salmon’s Argument**

1. **Conjunctive Fork Principle:**
    
    - This principle explains correlations between events through a common cause.
    - In the case of Avogadro’s number, the consistent results across experiments imply atoms are the common cause of observed phenomena.
2. **Realism Through Experimental Convergence:**
    
    - Salmon argues that if atoms didn’t exist, the agreement across independent methods would be an implausible coincidence.
    - The convergence of results provides robust evidence for the atomic model of matter.

#### **Philosophical Implications**

1. **Challenge to Instrumentalism:**
    
    - Salmon counters the instrumentalist view by showing that multiple independent lines of evidence point to the reality of unobservable entities.
    - The consistency across experiments cannot be explained without assuming the reality of atoms.
2. **Strength of the Argument:**
    
    - Salmon likens the agreement across experiments to multiple witnesses independently reporting the same details, which increases confidence in their account.

#### **Conclusion**

Salmon uses historical examples, particularly Perrin’s work on Avogadro’s number, to argue for scientific realism. By demonstrating that independent experimental methods consistently yield the same results, he supports the existence of unobservable entities like atoms as real, causally effective components of the physical world. This approach underscores the philosophical robustness of using empirical evidence and reasoning to justify realism in science.
