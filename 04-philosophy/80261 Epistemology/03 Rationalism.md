## Rationalism vs. Empiricism Debate

- This debate focuses on how we gain knowledge, particularly about the external world, with rationalists emphasizing reason and empiricists prioritizing sense experience.
- The distinction between rationalism and empiricism is not clear-cut; some, like Descartes, display both rationalist and empiricist tendencies.
- Empiricism acknowledges the role of reason in epistemology, just as rationalists accept the necessity of sensory experiences for acquiring knowledge.
- The debate between empiricism and rationalism centers on the importance and nature of the roles of experience versus reason.

## Rationalist View

- Some concepts and knowledge are independent of sense experience.
- Knowledge can be gained through intuition (direct insight) and deduction (logical reasoning).
- The distinction between rationalism and empiricism is not clear-cut; some, like Descartes, display both rationalist and empiricist tendencies.
- Three categories of knowledge: knowledge of the external world, knowledge of the internal world or self-knowledge, and knowledge of moral and/or aesthetical values

## Empiricist View

- Knowledge is primarily derived from sensory experience (both sense and reflective).
- Empiricists counter rationalists by explaining how experience alone provides the knowledge rationalists claim, and that reflective understanding can fill in gaps.

## Key Concepts in Rationalism

- What is the nature of propositional knowledge (knowledge that a particular proposition about the world, ourselves, morality, or beauty is true)?
	- **Propositional knowledge** requires belief, truth, and an additional element called "warrant," which distinguishes knowledge from a lucky guess.
	- warrant: the justification of a belief that raises its epistemic status from mere belief to “warranted as” knowledge by evidence.
- How can we gain knowledge?
	- We can form true beliefs through luck, but gaining **warranted beliefs** is more complex and unclear.
- What are the limits of our knowledge?
	- Some aspects of the external world, ourselves, or the moral and aesthetical values may be within the **limits of our thought** but beyond the **limits of our knowledge**.
	- beyond limits of our knowledge: cannot know which description is true
	- beyond limits of our thought: cannot form intelligible descriptions of them
- The **rationalism vs. empiricism** debate focuses on the second question - the sources of concepts and knowledge, with implications for other philosophical questions.

### Intuition/Deduction Thesis

- **Intuition/Deduction Thesis**: Some knowledge is known through direct intuition or deduced logically without relying on experience. (agreed by both schools)
- **Intuition** is a direct, immediate insight similar to internal perception, allowing us to "see" propositions as true.
- **Deduction** is deriving conclusions from intuited premises through valid arguments, leading to a priori knowledge independent of experience.
- **Criticism**: Requiring certainty for knowledge is problematic, as it excludes much of what we commonly consider knowledge.
- **Leibniz's Argument**: Experience only provides particular truths (instances), not the universal necessity needed for certain knowledge (e.g., in mathematics).
    - **Necessary truths** (like those in math) must come from **intuition and deduction**, not sense experience.
    - Leibniz supports the **Innate Knowledge Thesis**, but his argument can also relate to the **Intuition/Deduction Thesis**.
- **Intuition vs. Experience**: Intuition provides knowledge beyond what experience can offer, especially in areas like logic, metaphysics, and morals.
- **Key Challenge**: Defenders of the **Intuition/Deduction Thesis** must clarify what intuition is and how it provides warranted true beliefs about the external world.
- **Metaphors insufficient**: Simply describing intuition as intellectual "grasping" or "seeing" doesn't explain how it leads to knowledge about the world.

### Innate Knowledge Thesis

- **Innate Knowledge Thesis**: We possess certain truths inherently as part of our nature, not acquired through experience or intuition/deduction.
- Experiences may trigger awareness of innate knowledge but do not provide the knowledge itself.
- Different rationalists believe innate knowledge comes from prior existence, divine provision, or natural selection.
- **Plato's Doctrine of Recollection**: Knowledge is recollected from a previous life where we had direct access to abstract truths (e.g., mathematics).
- **Modern Perspective**: Few support Plato's view today, but many adopt forms of innate knowledge due to the lack of adequate explanations for certain knowledge gained without experience.
- **Carruthers' View**: Evolutionary selection determines our innate knowledge, which emerges at specific life stages. Experience triggers belief but doesn't provide the knowledge itself.
- **Problem**: How can innate beliefs be **warranted** if they are not based on experience, intuition, or deduction? Rationalists argue these beliefs are warranted despite not deriving from these sources.

### Innate Concept Thesis

- **Innate Concept Thesis**: Some concepts are inherent in our rational nature and are not derived from experience.
- While experiences can bring these innate concepts to consciousness, they do not supply or define the content of the concepts.
- **Descartes’ View**: He divides ideas into three categories:
    - **Adventitious** (gained through experience, like heat),
    - **Invented** (created by combining existing ideas, like a hippogriff),
    - **Innate** (placed in our minds by God, like the concepts of God or perfect geometry).
- **Example**: Descartes argues that the concept of an infinitely perfect being (God) cannot be derived from experience, as experience only provides limited concepts of finite beings.
- **Locke’s Empiricist Response**:
    - Argues against the existence of innate concepts, noting that people (e.g., children or those from different cultures) do not consciously entertain the concept of God.
    - Claims that experience can account for all our concepts, including those thought to be innate, without the need for innate concepts.


- Intuition/Deduction thesis is equally important to empiricism. The key difference between rationalists and empiricists regarding the **Intuition/Deduction Thesis** is the source of intuitions:
	- For **rationalists**, intuitions are largely **innate**.
	- For **empiricists** like Locke, intuitions are derived from **sensory experiences**.
- **Rationalism** centers on two key theses: the **Innate Knowledge Thesis** (innate knowledge of propositions) and the **Innate Concept Thesis** (innate knowledge of concepts).
- Rationalists adjust the strength of their view based on how they define **warrant**:
    - Some argue intuition leads to absolutely certain beliefs.
    - Others hold intuition provides beliefs that are beyond reasonable doubt but not infallible.
- **Indispensability of Reason Thesis**: Knowledge from reason (intuition and deduction) cannot be obtained through sense experience.
- **Superiority of Reason Thesis**: Knowledge from reason is superior to knowledge gained from sense experience.
- Descartes, for example, claimed that knowledge from intuition is absolutely certain, while sense experience-based knowledge has some degree of uncertainty.

- **Philosophical Examples**:
	- Descartes is often cited as a rationalist, emphasizing the role of intuition and reason in knowing certain truths (e.g., the existence of God).
	- Empiricists like Locke counter that all knowledge can be traced to experience, even complex ideas like the concept of God.
