- **Entitlement Theory of Justice:**
	- Nozick lays out his "entitlement theory," where justice in holdings is determined by how property is acquired, transferred, and rectified, rather than through a predetermined pattern of distribution. 
	  权利理论: 关注社会中**财产和物品的分配**。他将其分为三个关键原则：
	- **Justice in Acquisition**: This principle refers to the just acquisition of holdings, where people can legitimately come to own things, provided they are not previously owned and are obtained through legitimate means.
	- **Justice in Transfer**: Once someone legitimately owns something, they are entitled to transfer it voluntarily to someone else, and the acquisition by the second person is legitimate, provided it follows voluntary exchange.
	- **Rectification of Injustice**: Nozick acknowledges that injustices can occur in acquisition or transfer. This principle concerns correcting those injustices and restoring holdings to their rightful owners if possible.

- **Historical vs. End-State Principles**
	- Nozick contrasts his theory with "end-state" or "patterned" theories of justice
	- "end-state" or "patterned" theories of justice: focus on how wealth or resources are distributed at a particular time, based on some pattern like equality, need, or merit. 
	  模式化正义：关注特定时间点财富或资源的分配模式，例如平等、需求或功绩
	- He argues that such theories violate individuals' rights to their holdings because they often require coercive redistribution.
	  他认为这些理论会侵犯个人对财产的权利，因为它们通常需要强制性的再分配。

- **Wilt Chamberlain Example**
	- Nozick famously uses a thought experiment involving basketball player Wilt Chamberlain to illustrate how **voluntary transactions can disrupt a pattern of distribution**. If people voluntarily pay to watch Chamberlain play basketball, he ends up with significantly more wealth than others. Nozick argues that this unequal distribution is just, as long as the initial distribution was just and all transactions were voluntary.
	- 诺齐克用一个关于篮球运动员威尔特·张伯伦的思想实验来说明自愿交易如何打破分配模式。如果人们自愿付费观看张伯伦打球，那么他会比其他人获得更多的财富。诺齐克认为，只要最初的分配是正当的，且所有交易都是自愿的，这种不平等的分配就是正当的。

- **Libertarian Critique of Redistribution**
	- Nozick strongly criticizes redistribution of wealth through taxation or welfare programs, suggesting that such practices violate individual rights. 
	- He compares it to forced labor, as people are compelled to work to support others through taxes.
	- 诺齐克强烈批评通过税收或福利计划进行的财富再分配，认为这种做法侵犯了个人权利。他将其比作强迫劳动，因为人们被迫为通过税收支持他人而工作。
    
- **Minimal State**
	- Nozick supports a minimal state, which only enforces contracts, protects people from force, theft, and fraud, and ensures justice. Any state that goes beyond this, particularly by redistributing wealth or providing social services, is seen as infringing on individual rights.
	  诺齐克支持“最小国家”，其唯一职责是执行合同，保护人们免受暴力、盗窃和欺诈，并确保正义。任何超出这一范围的国家行为，尤其是财富再分配或提供社会服务，都被认为侵犯了个人权利。
    - **Justification of the Minimal State:**
	    - Individuals naturally form protective associations in a state of nature.
	    - Over time, these protective associations evolve into a minimal state, driven by the need for security and order without coercion.
  
- **Concept of 'Utopia':**
	- Nozick introduces the idea of a "framework for utopia," where different individuals or groups can freely pursue their visions of a good life within the minimal state.
	- Each group can form its community, provided it doesn't infringe on others' rights.

- **Critique of Utilitarianism and Socialism**
	- Nozick critiques **utilitarianism** for justifying the violation of individual rights for the greater good. 
	  诺齐克批评功利主义，因为它为集体利益而牺牲个人权利提供了正当性。
	- Similarly, he critiques **socialism** for its focus on patterned distributions, which he argues are incompatible with individual liberty.
	  他批评社会主义，认为其对模式化分配的关注与个人自由不相容。
