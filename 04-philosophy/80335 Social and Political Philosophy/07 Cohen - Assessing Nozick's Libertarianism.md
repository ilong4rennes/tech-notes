- **Introduction to Nozick’s Libertarianism**:
	- Robert Nozick's political philosophy in *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* is centered around the principle of self-ownership rather than freedom itself.
	  罗伯特·诺齐克在《无政府、国家与乌托邦》中的政治哲学核心是“自我所有”原则，而非自由本身。
	- Self-ownership suggests that individuals own themselves, including their powers and bodies, and are morally free to use them without aggression toward others.
	  自我所有：个人拥有自己，包括其能力和身体，并在道德上自由使用这些权利，只要不对他人施加侵略。
	- For Nozick, self-ownership is more fundamental than freedom, which implies that freedom flows from self-ownership rather than being an independent starting point.
	  对诺齐克而言，自我所有比自由更为基础，这意味着自由是由自我所有派生的，而非独立的起点。

- **Property Rights and Inequality （财产权和不平等）**:
	- Nozick believes that self-ownership extends to property rights: individuals have the right to accumulate external resources, leading to inequality.
	  诺齐克认为，自我所有延伸到财产权：个人有权积累外部资源，这会导致不平等。
	- The unequal distribution of resources is justified as long as individuals’ initial acquisitions are legitimate and do not violate others' self-ownership.
	  只要个体的初始占有是合法的，没有侵犯他人的自我所有，这种资源的不平等分配就是正当的。
	- This generates significant inequality in society, but for Nozick, as long as the acquisitions are legitimate, the inequality is protected morally.
	  这种不平等在社会中产生了巨大的差距，但在诺齐克看来，只要占有是合法的，不平等在道德上是受到保护的。

- **Redistributive Taxation and Helping Others （对再分配税和帮助他人的反对）**:
	- Nozick opposes redistributive taxation because it forces individuals to serve others, which he argues is morally wrong, as it violates self-ownership.
	  诺齐克反对再分配税，因为它强迫个人为他人服务，他认为这在道德上是错误的，因为它侵犯了自我所有。
	- Although Nozick doesn’t oppose helping others, he insists that such help must be voluntary and not forced through taxation.
	  虽然诺齐克并不反对帮助他人，但他坚持这种帮助必须是自愿的，而不是通过税收强迫的。

- **Critique of Self-Ownership by the Left**:
	- Cohen presents a common critique from leftist thinkers: self-ownership generates unacceptable inequalities, and they advocate for equality of condition over absolute self-ownership.
	- Some left-wing perspectives argue that people should be forced to help others to ensure a more equal distribution of wealth and opportunity.
	- However, Cohen notes that the principle of self-ownership is intuitively appealing, even to critics of inequality, which complicates the debate.
	- 科恩提出了左派思想家的常见批判：自我所有导致不可接受的不平等，他们主张平等的生活条件，而不是绝对的自我所有。
	- 一些左派观点认为，为了确保财富和机会的更平等分配，人们应该被迫帮助他人。
	- 然而，科恩指出，自我所有的原则对许多人来说具有直觉上的吸引力，甚至对那些反对不平等的人，这使得辩论更加复杂。

- **Legitimate Appropriation of Resources (资源的合法占有)**:
	- One of the main issues Cohen raises is how Nozick justifies the initial acquisition of external resources, which then leads to vast inequalities.
	- Nozick’s theory of entitlement rests on the Lockean proviso that appropriation is legitimate if it does not worsen others' conditions.
	- However, Cohen criticizes Nozick’s interpretation of this proviso, arguing that it is too lax and that appropriation often worsens the condition of others.
	- 科恩提出的一个主要问题是，诺齐克如何为外部资源的初始占有提供正当性，而这种占有又导致了巨大的不平等。
	- 诺齐克的权利理论基于洛克的前提，即占有是合法的，只要它没有使他人的状况变得更糟。
	- 然而，科恩批评诺齐克对这一前提的解释，认为其过于宽松，占有往往会使他人的状况恶化。

- **Example of Appropriation**:
	- Cohen presents a hypothetical scenario where one person (A) appropriates land, leaving another person (B) with fewer opportunities. A then hires B to work the land.
	- While B may be better off under A’s ownership than under common ownership, Cohen points out that this arrangement still creates a power imbalance that undermines freedom.
	- The power dynamics and inequalities produced through this kind of appropriation challenge Nozick’s defense of capitalist property rights.
	- 

- **Cohen’s Critique of Capitalism**:
	- Cohen extends his critique to the broader defense of capitalism. He argues that even though capitalism may produce overall economic growth, it doesn’t ensure fairness or equality for all individuals.
	- He also points out that Nozick’s theory depends on empirical claims that are open to challenge, such as the idea that people in a capitalist society are always better off than they would be under other systems.

- **Alternative Approaches to Equality**:
	- Cohen suggests that leftists should not reject self-ownership outright but should instead focus on challenging the unequal distribution of resources that self-ownership can justify.
	- He advocates for an egalitarian distribution of worldly resources while still affirming the principle of self-ownership to some extent.
	- In his view, socialist equality and self-ownership are incompatible, and thus those who value equality must reject full self-ownership, even if external resources are equally distributed.

- **Conclusion**:
	- Cohen concludes that while Nozick’s theory provides a strong defense of inequality through self-ownership, it fails to justify the resulting social and economic disparities adequately.
	- He argues for a new framework that better balances self-ownership with a more equal distribution of resources, though he acknowledges the difficulty of designing such a system.

- Two lines of attack:
	- Reject self-ownership
		- Prioritize value of equality of condition (egalitarian)
	- Argue that self-ownership does not necessitate capitalism
		-
