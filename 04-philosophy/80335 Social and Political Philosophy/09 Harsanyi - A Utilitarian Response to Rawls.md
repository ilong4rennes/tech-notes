- **Rawls's Theoretical Framework**:
	- John Rawls, in *A Theory of Justice*, contrasts two traditions in moral philosophy: utilitarianism and contractarianism (social contract theory).
	- Rawls introduces the "original position" under the "veil of ignorance," where rational individuals choose principles of justice without knowing their social or economic status.

- **Maximin Principle & Difference Principle**:
	- Maximin Principle: You should **choose the option where the worst possible outcome is the best among all the worst-case scenarios**. In other words, **focus on minimizing the worst-case harm**.
		- Rawls uses the maximin decision rule for individuals in the original position, emphasizing the welfare of the least advantaged in society.
	- The "difference principle" emerges from this, suggesting institutions should maximize the welfare of the worst-off.
	- Difference principle: **Inequalities in wealth, power, or resources are acceptable, but only if they help the people who are worst off** in society.

- **Harsanyi's Objections**:
	- **Irrationality of the Maximin Principle**:
		- In real-world scenarios, the maximin principle often leads to paradoxical and impractical decisions.
		- Example: Preferring highly improbable outcomes (e.g., avoiding air travel due to a slight risk of a plane crash) over significant benefits (e.g., a better job in another city).
		- Rational decisions require balancing risks and rewards using probabilistic and utility-based reasoning, as per Bayesian decision theory.
	
	- **Critique of the Difference Principle**:
		- Harsanyi highlights morally questionable outcomes under Rawls’s difference principle:
		  - Allocating scarce resources (like medicine or education) to the worst-off, even when this provides minimal benefit compared to helping others.
		  - Example: Treating a terminally ill patient over a curable one solely because the former is worse off.

  - **Issues of Rigidity**:
    - Rawls’s framework imposes inflexible prioritization of the least advantaged, disregarding broader societal benefits and individual merit.

- **Harsanyi's Alternative**:
	- Advocates for the **expected-utility maximization** principle:
		- Individuals in the original position should choose policies maximizing the average utility, reflecting collective well-being rather than prioritizing extremes.
		- This approach aligns with utilitarian principles and accounts for interpersonal utility comparisons, balancing fairness with practical outcomes.

- **Defense Against Rawls's Criticisms**:
	- Harsanyi defends the use of probabilities in moral reasoning, countering Rawls's dismissal of subjective probabilities.
	- He explains that interpersonal utility comparisons are essential and feasible, as humans can empathize with others’ preferences and circumstances.

- **Broader Implications**:
	- Harsanyi emphasizes that utilitarian principles, when correctly interpreted, allow for a balanced moral framework:
		- Recognizes the value of supererogatory (above duty) actions.
		- Avoids the extreme demands of classical utilitarianism or Rawls's rigid rules.

- **Practical Recommendations**:
	- Harsanyi acknowledges the maximin principle’s utility in specific contexts, like income distribution or taxation, as an approximation tool rather than a moral foundation.

- **Final Assessment**:
	- While Rawls raises significant moral questions, Harsanyi argues his solutions are flawed and overly simplistic.
	- Utilitarianism offers a more flexible and inclusive approach to justice, avoiding the discriminatory implications of Rawls's theory.

This critique underscores a fundamental philosophical debate: whether morality should prioritize fairness to the least advantaged (Rawls) or maximize collective well-being (utilitarianism).
