- **Republican Concept of Freedom**:
	- **Freedom as Non-domination**:
		- Central to Pettit's argument is that true freedom exists when an individual is not subject to domination by others.
		- This concept differs from the classical liberal understanding of freedom, which typically focuses on *non-interference*.
		- Pettit argues that non-domination provides a more robust understanding of liberty because it emphasizes the ability of individuals to act without the threat of arbitrary interference.
	- **非干涉（Non-Interference）**
		- **定义**：非干涉指没有直接的阻碍或干预，认为只要没有人妨碍你的行动，你就是自由的。
		- **例子**：你走在街上，没人拦你或干涉你的自由，那么你是“自由”的。
		- **批评**：即使没有人干涉你，如果某人有能力随时干涉你，你依然会感到受制，例如老板可以随时解雇你，即使他现在没有这么做。
	- **非支配（Non-Domination）**
		- **定义**：非支配强调不仅没有直接干涉，还不能受到他人任意控制或支配。真正的自由是当没有人有权任意支配你。
		- **例子**：如果一个雇主有权随意解雇你，你就是在受支配。非支配的自由意味着雇主不能随意行使权力，法律保护你免受不公正的控制。
	- 关键区别：
		- **非干涉**关注当前是否有人阻止你做某事。
		- **非支配**关注是否有人拥有随时控制你的权力，即使他们现在没有这么做。
  
- **Critique of Liberal Notions of Freedom**:
  - **Non-interference vs. Non-domination**:
    - Pettit critiques the liberal view, which equates freedom with the absence of interference (negative liberty).
    - He contends that non-interference is insufficient because someone might not interfere with you, but still have the *power* to do so arbitrarily, which undermines true freedom.
    - For example, in relationships such as employer-employee or government-citizen, the ability to dominate remains, even if actual interference doesn't occur.

- **The Role of Institutions**:
  - **Preventing Arbitrary Power**:
    - Republican freedom is sustained by creating institutions that ensure power cannot be exercised arbitrarily.
    - Pettit discusses the need for laws and political structures that prevent anyone from having unchecked power over others.
    - This includes ensuring that institutions are accountable and that people have recourse to contest arbitrary actions.
  
- **Domination and Dependence**:
  - **Systemic Domination**:
    - Pettit argues that domination often arises from systems of dependence, such as economic inequalities or legal imbalances.
    - A person may be in a vulnerable position (e.g., financial dependence) that leaves them open to domination by others who hold power over them.
  
- **Positive and Negative Liberty in Republicanism**:
  - **Integrating Positive Freedom**:
    - While Pettit focuses primarily on freedom from domination, he also acknowledges the importance of certain forms of *positive liberty* (i.e., the capacity to act and achieve goals).
    - He argues that a republican approach to freedom includes creating conditions that allow individuals to flourish, not just protecting them from domination.

- **Historical Context of Republican Freedom**:
  - **Classical and Modern Republicanism**:
    - Pettit situates his arguments within the tradition of republican thought, tracing back to ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy, where the concept of non-domination was integral to political life.
    - Modern republicanism, in his view, needs to adapt these ideas to contemporary political and social realities.

- **Implications for Democratic Governance**:
  - **Democratic Accountability**:
    - Pettit suggests that a properly functioning democracy is essential for sustaining non-domination.
    - Institutions must be designed so that all citizens have a say in how power is exercised, ensuring that no group or individual can wield arbitrary control.
