### Key Themes and Concepts
1. **Epistemic Injustice**:
   - Defined as harm to someone in their capacity as a knower.
   - Includes prejudices, implicit or explicit, that lead to a failure to believe testimony or marginalize certain voices.

2. **Credibility and Testimony**:
   - Hearers rely on various sources of information (e.g., a speaker's reliability, manner of delivery, background knowledge) to judge credibility.
   - **Credibility deficits** occur when individuals are underestimated as credible due to identity-based biases.
   - **Credibility excesses** involve overestimating someone’s credibility, which can perpetuate others' credibility deficits.

3. **Miranda Fricker's Contributions**:
   - Coined the term "epistemic injustice" and outlined two main types:
	- **Testimonial Injustice**: Occurs when prejudices lead to dismissing someone's testimony.
	- **Hermeneutical Injustice**: Happens when marginalized groups lack the shared resources to make sense of their experiences.
	- **证言上的不公正**（Testimonial Injustice）：因偏见而忽视某人的证言。
	- **诠释上的不公正**（Hermeneutical Injustice）：边缘化群体缺乏共享的诠释资源，无法理解或表达自身经验。

### Detailed Points

#### Testimonial Injustice:
- **Examples and Case Studies**:
  - *The Talented Mr. Ripley*: Marge's evidence about a murder is dismissed due to gendered prejudices, exemplifying credibility deficits.
  - *To Kill a Mockingbird*: Tom Robinson, a Black man, is disbelieved in court because of racial prejudices, demonstrating the intersection of credibility deficits and societal biases.

- **Critiques and Expansions**:
  - Scholars like José Medina argue that Fricker's focus on deficits overlooks the interplay between deficits and excesses in credibility judgments. 过于关注可信度不足，而忽视了可信度过高与不足之间的相互作用。
  - Credibility is interactive and contextual rather than distributive, emphasizing comparisons across social dynamics.

#### Hermeneutical Injustice 诠释上的不公正：
- **Definition and Mechanisms**:
	- Occurs when a gap in shared "hermeneutical resources" obstructs marginalized groups from understanding and expressing their experiences.
	- For instance, prior to the feminist movement, workplace harassment was often dismissed as harmless flirting.
	- 当共享的“诠释资源”不足以帮助边缘化群体理解和表达自身经验时，就会发生诠释上的不公正。
	- 例如，在女性主义运动之前，职场性骚扰常被视为“无害的调情”。

- **Resistance to Hermeneutical Progress**:
	- Dominant groups may resist adopting new hermeneutical tools (e.g., acknowledging "white privilege" or "rape culture"), which perpetuates structural oppression.
	- 主流群体可能抵制接受新的诠释工具（例如“白人特权”或“强奸文化”），从而延续结构性压迫。

#### Extensions and Applications:
- **Epistemic Ignorance**:
  - Marginalized individuals may lack resources to comprehend oppression, while dominant groups may remain willfully ignorant to maintain systemic inequalities.
  
- **Epistemic Violence and Oppression**:
  - Exclusion of certain knowledge systems and dismissal of testimony causes political and epistemic harm, exemplifying epistemic violence.
  - Phenomena like "testimonial quieting" (ignoring someone's testimony entirely) and "testimonial smothering" (self-censorship due to anticipated dismissal) further deepen epistemic marginalization.

### Implications and Broader Relevance:
- **Social Epistemology**:
  - Recent trends recognize knowledge as inherently social, involving trust, power dynamics, and political considerations.
  - Questions of who is believed and why are critical to understanding how epistemic justice or injustice unfolds in societal structures.

- **Applications in Various Fields**:
  - Explored in medical ethics, education, propaganda studies, and more.
  - Scholars connect epistemic injustice to broader societal issues like gaslighting, allyship, and developmental policy.
