- **Foundational Principles of Marxism:**
	- Emphasis on historical materialism: understanding history as a progression driven by material economic conditions.
	- The centrality of class struggle: the conflict between the bourgeoisie (capital owners) and the proletariat (working class).
	- The critique of capitalism: identifying its exploitative nature and its tendency toward economic crises.

- **Marxist Economic Theory:**
	- Labor theory of value: the idea that labor is the source of all value.
	- Alienation under capitalism: workers are estranged from their labor, the products they create, and their human potential.
	- Surplus value and exploitation: the capitalists' extraction of value from workers' labor beyond what is paid as wages.

- **Historical Context:**
	- Development of Marxism in the 19th century as a response to industrial capitalism.
	- Marx's prediction of capitalism's collapse due to internal contradictions, leading to socialism and eventually communism.

- **Marxism and Political Philosophy:**
	- Rejection of liberal individualism: Marx's view of individuals as fundamentally shaped by their social and economic contexts.
	- Criticism of liberal democracy: seen as serving capitalist interests rather than genuinely representing the working class.
	- Advocacy for a classless, stateless society as the end goal.

- **Critiques and Revisions of Marxism:**
	- Challenges to Marx's economic predictions, including capitalism's adaptability.
	- The rise of "revisionist" Marxism: attempts to integrate aspects of liberalism or adapt Marxist theory to modern contexts.
	- Criticism of Marx's neglect of issues like gender, race, and environmental concerns.

- **Contemporary Relevance:**
	- Examination of Marxism's influence on modern political movements.
	- Discussion of its continued critique of inequality and its analysis of power dynamics in capitalist societies.
	- Evaluation of the failures of Marxist states and the impact on Marxist theory.
