- **Types of documentation** 
	- Reference documentation (incl. code comments) 
	- Design documents 
	- Tutorials 
	- Conceptual documentation 
	- Landing pages

- **Design documents** 
	- Code review before there is code! 
	- Collaborative (Google Docs) 
	- Ensure various concerns are covered, such as: security implications, internationalization, storage requirements, and privacy concerns. 
	- A good design doc should cover 
		- Goals and use cases for the design 
		- Implementation ideas (not too specific!) 
		- Propose key design decisions with an emphasis on their individual tradeoffs
	- The best design docs suggest design goals, and cover alternative designs, documenting the strengths and weaknesses of each. 
	- The worst design docs accidentally embed ambiguities, which cause implementors to develop contradictory solutions that the customer doesn’t want.

- **Common parts/templates** 
	1. Metadata: version, date, authors 
	2. Executive Summary: problem being solved, project mission 
	3. Stakeholders (and non-stakeholders) 
	4. Scenarios / User Stories 
	5. User Experience

	1. High-level Requirements: Functional • Global Requirements: Quality, Security, Privacy, Ethics 
	2. Features and Operations 
	3. Design Considerations and Tradeoffs 
	4. Non-Goals 
	5. Roadmap / Timeline 
	6. Open Issues

- **Examples: SourceGraph RFCs**
	- RFCs (Requests for Comments) within the context of SourceGraph.
