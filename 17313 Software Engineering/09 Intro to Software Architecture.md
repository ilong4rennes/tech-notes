**Why Document Architecture?** 
- Blueprint for the system
	- Artifact for early analysis 
	- Primary carrier of quality attributes 
	- Key to post-deployment maintenance and enhancement 
- Documentation speaks for the architect, today and 20 years from today
	- As long as the system is built, maintained, and evolved according to its documented architecture 
- Support traceability.
