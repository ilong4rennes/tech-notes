2) David Truncellito, “Epistemology” – Excerpts.

## Learning Goals
### **I. Course Overview**
- Focus: Human knowledge (epistemology).
- You have a complex story of sensory **experiences**, construction of mental and extra-mental **representations** of the natural world, and diverse **ways of reasoning** with both to develop what we call our “knowledge.” Often, our goal is such reasoning is arriving at **true** **beliefs**.

### **II. Philosophical and Scientific Analyses**
- My view is that philosophy can be characterized quite generally as the effort to understand many different features of human life.  
- Philosophers pursue questions about 
	- the nature of physical reality (metaphysical / ontological answers), 
		- How we come to know the various worlds we live in (physical, mental, emotional, mathematics, aesthetic, etc.) affects what claims we can reasonably make about those “realities.”
	- how humans should treat one another, 
	- what constitutes good reasoning, 
	- how we “know” about the world and ourselves.
- Course will combine philosophical approaches with scientific inquiries (psychology, formal models) to understand epistemology.

### **III. Importance of Studying Epistemology**
- Knowledge acquisition and justification are complex and often unreliable.
	- Yesterday’s “knowledge” becomes today’s “error".
- Knowledge in the form of “justified true beliefs” - defined by Plato
	- what we think we can count on to navigate and manage our environment to achieve our goals.  
	- justified? 
		- it turns out that providing such justifications is more complex than we might hope!
	- true?
		- it would seem foolish to base our decisions on beliefs which we merely **hope are true**. 

## **David Truncellito’s “Epistemology” Overview**
- Epistemology: Study of knowledge.
- Two main tasks: 
  1. Determine the nature of knowledge (what it means to know something).
  2. Understand the extent of human knowledge (how much we can know, limitations).
- Different kinds of knowledge: Procedural (know-how), acquaintance (familiarity), propositional (knowledge-that).
- Focus primarily on propositional knowledge.

### **Kinds of Knowledge**
- "Epistemology" derives from Greek: "episteme" (knowledge) + "logos" (study of).
- Knowledge used in various ways, philosophers focus on factive sense (only true things can be known).
- Propositional knowledge: Expressed by declarative sentences, involves knowledge of facts or states of affairs.
- One **goal of epistemology** is to **determine the criteria for knowledge so that we can know what can or cannot be known**.
- Classified based on source: 
	- A priori (independent of experience): requires only the use of reason.
	- A posteriori (dependent on experience): possible only subsequent to certain sense experiences (in addition to the use of reason).

### **The Nature of Propositional Knowledge**
- What does it mean for someone to know something?
	- Epistemologists have usually undertaken this task by seeking a correct and complete analysis of the concept of knowledge, in other words a set of **individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions** which determine whether someone knows something

#### **Belief**
- Knowledge is a mental state (knowledge exists in one's mind)
- Knowledge is a specific kind of mental state (not desires or intentions)
- Knowledge is a kind of belief. Without belief, one cannot have knowledge.

#### **Truth**
- Knowledge requires belief. Belief is _necessary_ but not _sufficient_ for knowledge (beliefs can be true or false).
	- the most typical purpose of beliefs is to describe or capture the way things actually are.
- Truth is a condition for knowledge.
- Purpose of belief: Match mind with the world.
- Objective truth exists, enabling beliefs to align with reality.

#### **Justification**
- Justification is what distinguishes knowledge from mere true belief.
- Requires sound reasoning and solid evidence.
- Justified beliefs are more likely to be true.

### **The Nature of Justification**
- Involves forming beliefs correctly.
- Two approaches:
	- Internalism: Justification depends on the believer's mental states.
	- Externalism: Justification depends on external factors.
- Goal: Achieve a match between mind and world.

#### a. **Internalism**
- Justification depends on factors internal to the believer's mind.
- Involves the believer's other mental states supporting new beliefs.
- Faces the regress problem: Justified beliefs requiring further justified beliefs.

##### i. **Foundationalism**
- Response to the regress problem.
- Basic beliefs do not require justification from other beliefs.
- These beliefs provide a foundation for other, non-basic beliefs.
- Asserts that some beliefs are self-justified or justified by non-belief sources.
##### ii. **Coherentism**
- A type of internalism.
- Justification comes from a holistic relationship among beliefs.
- Vulnerable to the isolation objection: Coherent beliefs may be isolated from reality.

#### b. **Externalism**
- Justification determined by external factors.
- Reliabilism: Beliefs are justified if formed by reliable cognitive processes.
