## Graph Search
### Shortest Path
- Step 1: Start with a weighted graph
- Step 2: Choose a starting vertex and assign infinity path values to all other devices
- Step 3: Go to each vertex and update its path length
- Step 4: If the path length of the adjacent vertex is lesser than new path length, don't update it
- Step 5: Avoid updating path lengths of already visited vertices
- Step 6: After each iteration, we pick the unvisited vertex with the least path length. So we choose 5 before 7
- Step 7: Notice how the rightmost vertex has its path length updated twice
- Step 8: Repeat until all the vertices have been visited
- O(E logV)

### DFS
```python
def dfs(g, s):  
  visited = {node: False for node in g}  
  stack = deque()  
  stack.append(s)  
  visited[s] = True  
  while stack:    
	  s = stack.pop()    
	  for i in g[s]:      
		  if visited[i] is False:        
			  stack.append(i)  
			  visited[i] = True
```
