# Obsidian Vault Backup

I use Obsidian to keep a record of my learning journey and project development process. This repository is updated periodically from my Obsidian vault. This way, I ensure that my notes and experiences are safely preserved even if I lose access to my computer.

## File Structure

- 01-templates: Contains templates used with QuickAdd macros to rapidly generate new notes with consistent structure.
- 02-knowledge: Notes and summaries from courses Iâ€™ve taken at CMU, as well as self-directed learning topics.
- 03-technology: Technical references, tools, and notes related to various technologies I explore.
- 04-projects: Documentation of my project development processes, including: high-level design decisions, problem-solving steps, and bug fixes and error resolution.
