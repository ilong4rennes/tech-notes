## **Pre-task experience**

- **Contrast**
	- Contrast is when something stands out because it’s different from what’s around it.
	- Emerges as: large size, dark value, isolation, spot color, recognizable form, texture.
- **Unifiers**
	- Unifiers are things that make objects look like they go together. They help organize a design or a composition so it feels like everything belongs.
	- **Similar Shape**: Shapes that are alike (like a bunch of circles) group together in your mind.
	- **Proximity**: Objects that are close together feel like a group—like people standing close in a photo.
	- **Continuation**: If one shape or line continues into another, our eyes follow it and see them as connected.
	- **Closure**: Our eyes like to fill in missing parts of a shape and see it as one whole piece (think of a dotted circle; we still see the circle even with gaps).
- **Unintended Contrast**
	- Unintended contrast emerges when contrast elements in lesser objects fight with the main object of contrast.
	- Framing objects instead of unifying them
	- A negative space shape that traps complicated white space shapes, distracting the user.
	- Any non-information areas become contrast areas that calls attention to the user.
- **Negative Space**
	- This is the empty area around and between the main objects in your design (“white space”).
	- Used well, negative space helps your design “breathe” and not feel too crowded.
- **Visual Dynamics**
	- Human tendency to apply 3D experience to 2D environments.
	- **Lessen Tension**: A straight horizontal line across a page can feel calm and balanced, like a peaceful horizon.
	- **Raise Tension**: A diagonal line might feel like it’s leaning or falling, creating a sense of movement or excitement—like someone is running downhill.
	- **Why it matters**: How you arrange lines, shapes, and angles can make a person feel relaxed or on edge, which affects how they experience what they’re looking at.
- Why the Pre-Task Experience Matters
	- **Situation**: When someone first sees a design, they instantly ask:
		- **Is this interesting?** (Does something pop out?)
		- **Is it organized?** (Does it look like it’s put together well?)
	- **What happens next**: If they think it’s interesting and well-organized, they’ll want to keep looking. If it feels boring or messy, they might move on without giving it more attention.

## **Color Theory**

·       **Color Schemes**

- **Monochromatic**: Using only one color but in different shades (lighter or darker versions).
- **Analogous**: Using colors that sit next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., yellow, orange, and red).
- **Complementary**: Using colors that are directly across from each other on the color wheel (e.g., red and green, blue and orange). They pop when placed side by side.
- **Split Complementary**: Choose one color, then instead of using its opposite, pick the two colors on either side of its opposite.

·       **Primary and Secondary Colors**

- **Primary Colors**: Red, Blue, Yellow (in traditional color mixing).
- **Secondary Colors**: Orange, Green, Purple (these are created by mixing two primary colors).

·       **Color as Meaning & Influence, Color as Culturally Bound, Color as an Organizing Element**

## **Typography Elements**

·       **Anatomy**
- **x-height**: The height of a lowercase letter (like the “x”) without ascenders or descenders.
- **Baseline**: The line that letters “sit” on. (If you wrote on lined paper, that horizontal line is like the baseline for your letters.)
- **Serif**: The little extra strokes or “feet” on the ends of letters.

- **Oldstyle serif**: More gentle, curved serifs (imagine fancy old books).
- **Modern serif**: Very thin, sharp serifs (more edgy, high-contrast).
- **Slab serif**: Thick, blocky serifs (chunky and bold).

- **Descender**: Part of a letter that goes below the baseline (like the tail in “g” or “y”).
- **Ascender**: Part of a letter that goes above the x-height (like the top of “b” or “d”).

·       **Letter Relationships**

- **Leading (Line Spacing)**: The space between lines of text. More space can look airy and less cramped.
- **Paragraph Spacing**: Extra space before or after paragraphs to show where one paragraph ends and another begins.
- **Line Length**: How wide each line of text is before wrapping to the next line. Too wide can be hard to read; too narrow can feel choppy.
- **Body Copy, Subhead, and Headline**:

- **Body Copy**: The main text (usually smaller).
- **Subhead**: A mini-title for sections (a bit bigger).
- **Headline**: The main title or biggest text that grabs attention.

- **Tracking and Kerning**:

- **Tracking**: The overall space between letters in a word or line.
- **Kerning**: The space between two specific letters (like adjusting space between “A” and “V” so they look balanced).

o   **Relationship Between x-height and Perceived Type Size**

- A typeface with a taller x-height looks bigger even if its point size is technically the same.
- **Example**: Some fonts “look” larger because their lowercase letters are taller.

o   **Typographic Color**

- Not about literal color, but the overall “darkness” or “lightness” of a block of text on a page.
- **Example**: A dense paragraph with little space has a “darker” typographic color. Increasing the line spacing makes the text look “lighter.”

·       **Type Classifications**

- **Oldstyle**: Rounded serifs, gentle contrast in strokes (like in very old books).
- **Transitional**: More contrast than Oldstyle, but not as extreme as Modern.
- **Modern**: Thin, crisp serifs and strong contrast between thick and thin strokes.
- **Sans Serif**: No serifs at all—clean and modern look (like Arial or Helvetica).
- **Slab Serif**: Chunky, thick serifs, often used for strong headlines (like Rockwell).

o   **Type Families:** A type “family” can include different weights (light, regular, bold) or styles (italic, condensed) that all share a common design.

## **Complementary Meaning (Image + Text Working Together)**

- **Ties**
	- **Grouping ties** visually unify images and text, signaling they belong together (e.g., by placing them close or overlapping). Think of grouping ties as the “glue” that physically or visually connects text and imagery.
	- **Bridging ties** link their meanings, prompting an “aha” moment that arises when viewers interpret image and text as one idea. Think of bridging ties as the “bridge” that makes people say, “Now I get how these two things go together!”
- **Image vs Text Meaning**
	- **Text** tends to follow a sequence
	- **Image** is understood by looking at spatial relationships (where things are placed, what they look like).
	- **Text** can make statements, ask questions, or give commands.
		- Example: “Save water,” “Why recycle?” or “Did you know...?”
	- **Image** shows places, people, colors, and textures—often quickly giving you a “feel” for something.
- **Classifications of Complementary Meaning**
	- **Clarify**: Audience lacks knowledge
		- **Example**: A photo of a frog plus text that says, “Frogs can jump 20 times their body length” helps clarify that fact.
	- **Contradict**: Audience sees the irony in a situation
		- **Example**: A billboard shows a giant burger but the text says, “Eat healthy!”—that’s contradicting.
	- **Challenge**: Audience disagrees with your perspective, confronts cognitive dissonance.
		- **Example**: A poster shows a luxurious item but the text reads, “Do you really need this?”—it challenges their thinking.
