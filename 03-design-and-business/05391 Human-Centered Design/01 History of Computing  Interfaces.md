- Topics: MMI, computer input pre-1950s, Vannevar Bush, Grace Hopper, Sketchpad, the mouse

- Interface: The point where two systems meet and interact

### Man-Machine Interfaces (MMI): precursor to HCI
- Jacquard Loom 提花织机 (1803)
- Tabulating Machines 制表机 (1890s)
- Mechanical to Electronic Computing: Plugboards 插接板 (1906-1940s)
- Specialized Machines to General Purpose Computers
- General Purpose Computers: ENIAC (1943-46)

### Pre-1950’s Computing 
- Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around 
- Resources so scarce, user interfaces were considered unnecessary overhead. 
- UI also meant waiting on the user. Computing was at such a premium, all software had to be written before hand and batch processed; kept machine at 100% utilization 
- Computers only run by computer experts. No real notion of end users

### Post-1950 Computing: Moving Beyond MMI 
- Towards richer view of Human-Computer Interaction 
- Pieces start to come together in late 1940s 
- Huge progress in electromechanical computers during WW2 and emergence of early digital computers 
- Wartime spawned huge bureaucracy -> enormous numbers of records / files 
	- What to do with all this information? Make it accessible and useful? Usable? 
- How do we unlock computing potential for applications beyond military/science

### Vannevar Bush
- Describes hypothetical system called Memex (“memory” + “index”)
- Augment not physical tasks, but mental ability 
- Extend the power of the human mind with computing

### Grace Hopper
- Created first compiler/linker in early 1950s 
- Converts A0 language to machine code 
- Paved the way for higher level languages 
	- Significantly reduced the barrier to entry! 
- Meant that scientists and engineers could use machines, not just computer experts.

### Early Computing and Input Methods
- Punch Cards
- Batch Processing (1945-1968)
	- Punch cards were used to input data into early computers, leading to batch processing systems where jobs were queued and processed one after another.
- Mainframes (60s-70s)
- Terminal / Command-line user interfaces
	- Mainframes dominated this era, with users interacting through terminal or command-line interfaces, requiring typed commands to operate the system.

### Non-keyboard Input Devices
- Joysticks (1908, 1920s) - directional control
- Trackball (1942) - precursor to the mouse
- Light Guns / Pens (1950s)
- Sketchpad (1963)
- Glove Keyboard (1960)
- Knee operated pointing devices (1960s)
- Touch screens (1965)
- Mouse (1964-67, 1968)

### Doug Englebart: The Mother of All Demos (1968)
- ... the complexity of the problems facing mankind is growing faster than our ability to solve them. Therefore, finding ways to augment our intellect would seem to be both a necessary and a desirable goal. 
- problem-solvers using computer-aided working stations required the ability to interact with information displays using some sort of device to move a cursor around the screen.

### Rapid Fire Timeline of Inventions (1972 - 2005+)
- Dynabook (1972)
- Apple II (1977)
- Xerox Star (1981)
- Macintosh (1984)
- Multi-Touch Screen (1985)
- Thinkpad (1992)
- Windows 95 (1995)
- Apple “Magic Mouse” (2005)

### Moore's Law / Human vs Computer
- Moore's Law: Transistor counts double every two years; Computational power growth exponentially, Also applies to RAM size and pixel densitie
- Human capabilities remains roughly the same throughout time the computational power increases really fast. 

### Core Principles 
- Design for people 
- Ideation ("Predict future by inventing it" - Alan Kay) 
- Prototyping 
- Evaluation (compare many alternatives) 
- Iteration (especially as new tech becomes available) 
- “Best” doesn’t always win

### Long Nose of Innovation (Bill Buxton)
- "There are no new ideas. Just refinements of old ones, iterating until some amorphous perfect storm wave sweeps them to overnight success!" - Bill Buxton![[Screen Shot 2024-08-30 at 18.46.18.png]]
