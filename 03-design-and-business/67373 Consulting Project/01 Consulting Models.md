![[Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 11.40.16 AM.png]]
- Technology:
	- Some software system (web app, mobile app, etc.)
- People:
	- Clearer understanding of the problem
	- Awareness of alternative solutions
	- Knowledge of design decisions that were made and why
	- Understanding of how to use the solution
	- Understanding of how to maintain/sustain the solution
- Process:
	- Experience in the inquiry through deployment phases of a software project.
	- New practices in the organization to use the solution.
	- New policies in the organization regarding use of the solution and the people responsible for the solution?

## Example Request

- The campus has been working on a Policy for Minors on Campus and we are planning to have a registration process to keep track of all programs and people who have been cleared to work with minors.
- Can students help me develop a database?
- I can work with Access but it has been a long time and I really don’t have time to do the development.
- I don’t think we need a complicated structure.
- This is where the conversation started.

## Solution

In fact, it was complicated and involved
- New policies by the University Trustees
- A lot of questions about privacy and confidentiality
- Lots of meetings regarding where the resulting system would be hosted and who would own and maintain it in the long run.
- Design issues concerning whether the work of the system could be delegated out to the campus organizations whose members need to have background checks
 i.e. a very interesting set of social-system questions (people and process) to sustain the technical-system

## Structuring unstructured problems

**Difficulty: problem vs solution**
- A client's request is often not in the form of a problem. Rather is it for a solution:
	- We need a website, a mobile app, an information system
- A solution is ONE approach to solving a problem or realizing an opportunity.
- A problem is something that is hindering the full attainment of the organization's mission.

**Your job is to:**
1. Articulate the client's view of the problem
	- I understand you don't have a database

2. Articulate the client's idea for a solution
	- And you would like to create one in Access

3. Understand for yourselves the problem and how it impacts the organization's mission.
	- Errors in managing donor information leading to lower donations and wasted staff time makes for fewer resources to (do mission)

4. Consider alternative solutions
	- Custom build a Ruby on Rails app
	- Build a donor CRM within SalesForce.com

5. Validate for yourselves the choice of solution
	- Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), more functions

6. Come to a common agreement with the client on the choice of solution.
