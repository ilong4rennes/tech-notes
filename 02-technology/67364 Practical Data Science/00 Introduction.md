What is Information Systems about?
- Adding Value to Organizations using Technology

## Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

**1. Hardware Revolution**
- **Mainframes** – Powerful centralized computers used in enterprises (e.g., IBM Z series).
- **Minicomputers** – Smaller than mainframes, used for mid-sized computing tasks (e.g., PDP-11, VAX).
- **Personal Computers (PCs)** – Consumer-accessible desktops and laptops (e.g., Apple MacBook, Dell XPS).
- **Pocket Devices** – Smartphones and tablets with computing power (e.g., iPhone, Samsung Galaxy).
- **Wearable Devices** – Smartwatches, AR/VR headsets, and fitness trackers (e.g., Apple Watch, Meta Quest, Fitbit).
- **Edge Computing Devices** – IoT-enabled hardware for decentralized processing (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson).

**2. Software Evolution**
- **Batch Processing Systems** – Early computing required jobs to be submitted in batches (e.g., IBM OS/360).
- **Interactive Systems** – Enabled real-time interaction with users (e.g., UNIX shell, Windows GUI).
- **Applications (Apps)** – Software for specific tasks, from desktop applications (Microsoft Office) to mobile apps (WhatsApp).
- **Embedded Software** – Found in smart devices, cars, and IoT (e.g., firmware in Tesla Autopilot, Arduino programs).
- **Development Methodologies**
    - **Waterfall** – Linear software development approach.
    - **Agile** – Iterative development (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).
    - **DevOps** – Integration of development and operations for continuous deployment (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).

**3. Communication Technologies**
- **Analog Communication** – Early phone systems, radio, and analog TV.
- **Digital Communication** – Internet protocols (TCP/IP), fiber optics, and 5G networks.
- **Audio Technologies** – MP3, AAC compression, VoIP (e.g., Zoom, Discord).
- **Video Technologies** – Streaming services (Netflix, YouTube), video conferencing (WebRTC).
- **Wireless Technologies** – Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Li-Fi, satellite communication (e.g., Starlink).

**4. Data Evolution**
- **Databases**
    - Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra)
    - NewSQL (Google Spanner, CockroachDB)
- **Big Data Technologies** – Hadoop, Apache Spark, and real-time processing.
- **Cloud Computing** – AWS, Azure, Google Cloud for scalable storage and computing.
- **Blockchain** – Decentralized data storage (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
- **AI & Data Science** – Machine learning, deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- **Edge & IoT Data** – Real-time processing at the edge (e.g., AWS Greengrass, Google Coral).

## Components of Computational Thinking

- Decomposition: Divide and Conquer
- Abstraction: Separate the “what” from the “how”
- Recognition: Look for similarities between problems
- Generalization: Adapt previous solutions to new problems
- Computation: How to express steps unambiguously
