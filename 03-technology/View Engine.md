A **view engine** is a library/framework that takes templates + data and generates HTML. In Express (Node.js), you plug in a view engine to render HTML pages.

Examples:
- **EJS** → View engine that processes `.ejs` files
- **Pug** → View engine that processes `.pug` files
- **Handlebars** → View engine that processes `.hbs` files
- **Benchpress** → Used in **NodeBB**, processes `.tpl` files
