### **Question 5: Describe a challenging project you worked on using JavaScript or React.**

"NodeBB is an open-source forum platform, similar to a Q&A app where students post questions, and professors or peers answer them. I was tasked with implementing a 'Mark as Resolved' feature to enhance usability by allowing users to track whether threads had been resolved.

For the backend, I created new API endpoints, updated controllers to process resolved status changes, and modified the database schema to store this information. On the frontend, I used React to build dynamic UI elements, such as badges that visually indicate whether a thread is resolved or unresolved. JavaScript was crucial for both backend logic and React components, ensuring seamless integration between the two.

A challenge arose during the PR review when a linter issue caused GitHub checks to fail. I collaborated with my team to resolve the issue and ensured functionality was unaffected. Additionally, I wrote comprehensive test cases to validate the feature’s performance.

This project improved the platform by making it easier for students and professors to track discussions, aligning with the platform’s mission of fostering efficient communication. The experience also highlights my ability to tackle full-stack challenges, maintain high-quality code, and collaborate effectively, all of which resonate with Armada’s focus on innovation and problem-solving."

"Ensuring code quality and consistency is vital, especially when working on complex projects like those at Armada. 

I achieve this through several practices. First, I write detailed test cases to validate functionality, covering both edge cases and standard workflows. For example, in the NodeBB project, I tested both backend API routing and frontend UI updates for the 'Mark as Resolved' feature. Second, I use static analysis tools like linters to enforce code standards and dynamic tools for runtime debugging. Finally, I participate in code reviews, where I both provide and receive feedback to ensure best practices are followed. To streamline these efforts, I often integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and linting. These practices have consistently enabled me to deliver reliable and maintainable code, as seen in the successful deployment of features like 'Mark as Resolved' in NodeBB."

Got it! Here’s a more detailed, storytelling-style version of each experience and project that will help you communicate effectively and engage your interviewer:


#### **1. Stockholm Makerspace – Contributor, Software Developer**

_"At Stockholm Makerspace, I joined an international open-source project with a mission to make our codebase more efficient and future-proof. One of my main tasks was to migrate 48 React class components to functional components using React Hooks. This might sound technical, but essentially, it meant rewriting parts of the app to make the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and faster. The result? We reduced the app’s size by 18%, which made it load quicker for users around the world._

_Beyond that, I worked on improving our deployment process by enhancing our CI/CD pipelines. I streamlined Docker-based deployments using GitHub Actions and automated repetitive tasks with Make and npm. This not only sped up our release cycles but also reduced the chances of deployment errors. I was also actively involved in reviewing and refactoring critical pieces of JavaScript and React code, identifying performance bottlenecks, and suggesting improvements that helped make the system more scalable and robust."


**🌍 Situation:**  
I worked on an international open-source project called **MakerAdmin**, developed by Stockholm Makerspace. The platform was designed to help manage makerspaces across Sweden, and the web app is all in Swedish. 

**🎯 Task:**  
My main task was to modernize the codebase by refactoring 48 legacy React files. These components were built using older versions of React, which relied heavily on class components instead of the more modern and efficient functional components supported by React 16. These components were complex and limited the scalability of the platform. (Beyond the codebase, I also noticed the project lacked clear documentation for onboarding new contributors, which made collaboration difficult for those unfamiliar with the system.)

**⚡ Action:**  
So I refactored all 48 files into functional components using React Hooks like `useState`. This made the codebase more maintainable, and scalable for future development. I communicated regularly with the codebase manager via email to align on priorities and expectations. I set personal deadlines for each phase of the refactoring process, stayed on track to complete the work on time, and even managed to improve the project documentation ahead of schedule, making it easier for future contributors to navigate the updated codebase

Working with a global team, I participated in code reviews and debugging sessions across different time zones, ensuring that all changes aligned with project goals.

#### **2. Scotty Lab – Contributor, Software Developer**

**Situation:**  
At Scotty Lab, I worked on maintaining a degree planning website used by over 5,000 students every month. One major issue students faced was understanding which courses depended on which prerequisites. The existing system had no way to visualize these relationships, making it difficult for students to plan their academic paths efficiently.

**Task:**  
I set out to develop a **dynamic prerequisite tree** that would provide a clear, interactive way for students to see how courses were connected. 

**Action:**  
I focused on building the **backend** for the dynamic prerequisite tree using **TypeScript**, I designed an API route to retrieve and process prerequisite data from **MongoDB** via an **Express.js backend**. The tree was designed to expand dynamically, showing dependencies in an intuitive graph-like structure. I worked closely with the frontend team to ensure the data was structured for easy integration into the **React** visualization.

**Result:**  
After launching the feature, students could instantly see how their courses connected, making planning significantly easier.

#### **3. CMU Gelfand Center – Web Development Intern**

_"At the Gelfand Center, I led the development of a responsive website designed for K-12 students, helping them access over 100 educational projects. What made this exciting was the challenge of ensuring the website remained high-performing even with thousands of users browsing simultaneously. I focused on optimizing performance and achieved a Lighthouse score of 97, which measures a website’s speed, accessibility, and best practices._

_One of my proudest contributions was designing a filtering system that allowed users to search projects by categories, grade levels, or subjects. This intuitive feature helped both students and teachers find the exact resources they needed quickly. I also led a team of five developers, collaborating with educational professionals to ensure that every feature we built aligned with classroom needs and made learning engaging and accessible for students of all ages."_

### 💻 **Project Descriptions (Storytelling-Style)**

#### **1. NodeBB – Interactive Q&A Forum Website**

_"In this project, my goal was to make the Q&A experience more efficient for users. I developed a 'Mark as Resolved' feature using Node.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript. Before this feature, users often struggled to figure out whether a question had already been answered. Now, users can clearly see which queries have solutions thanks to UI badges that visually indicate resolved issues._

_I also integrated JSHint into our development pipeline, ensuring code quality through automated linting in GitHub Actions. This move reduced syntax errors by 22%, meaning fewer bugs and cleaner code overall. Finally, I worked on deploying a translation microservice using Azure and Flask. This was a game-changer for international users, enabling seamless multi-language support powered by an LLM-based translation API."_

---

#### **2. ReviewMaster – Yelp-like Recommendation System**

_"ReviewMaster was one of my favorite projects because it combined full-stack development with machine learning. I built the core platform using Python, Django, and MySQL, allowing users to register, browse businesses, and leave reviews—just like Yelp. What made our platform unique was the personalized recommendation system I developed._

_The recommendation system was designed to combine content-based and collaborative filtering to offer suggestions tailored to individual preferences. For example, if you liked a particular coffee shop, the system would suggest similar businesses nearby based on both your history and what other users with similar tastes enjoyed. On the infrastructure side, I optimized our MySQL queries for performance and deployed the entire platform on AWS, ensuring scalability as our user base grew."_

#### **3. GCPD Crime Tracking System**

_"In this project, I developed a full-stack crime tracking web app using Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The system allowed users to track crime incidents in real time while providing visual insights and secure data handling._

_One of the biggest technical challenges was implementing 12 RESTful API endpoints with authentication and versioning. This ensured secure access to sensitive crime data and allowed future updates without breaking existing functionality. I also focused on code reliability, achieving 100% unit test coverage using RSpec—meaning every piece of the code was tested to prevent bugs from creeping into production. Lastly, I implemented role-based access control, allowing different permissions for users, such as law enforcement officers vs. general users, ensuring sensitive data was protected."_

#### Shell

This shell interprets user commands, runs external programs (via `fork`/`exec`), and manages foreground/background jobs and signals. Essentially, it is a simplified version of `bash`

Through this project, I learned how to parse command lines and implement internal commands like `quit`, `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg`. I also worked on running external commands with `fork` and `execve`, while setting the new process’s group ID to ensure proper handling of terminal signals. One important aspect was redirecting input/output using `dup2`, allowing me to handle file descriptors in a robust, efficient way.

A major highlight of the Shell Lab is properly managing concurrent processes. For example, blocking signals at critical points prevents race conditions when updating shared data structures, like the job list. Handling `SIGCHLD` events ensures that terminated or stopped child processes are reaped correctly, which avoids zombie processes. Forwarding signals such as `SIGINT` and `SIGTSTP` to the current foreground job, rather than the shell itself, demonstrates practical job control logic in action.

Ultimately, the Shell Lab illustrates my ability to write clean, modular code under real system constraints—like concurrency, synchronization, and error handling. It also shows I can debug complex interactions between multiple processes and signals. Beyond just building a shell, it taught me to architect solutions that handle asynchronous events gracefully, a valuable skill for any software engineering position.


**Step 1: Parse Command Lines and Implement Internal Commands**  
I first learned to parse user commands effectively and recognize internal commands (`quit`, `jobs`, `fg`, and `bg`). By splitting the command line into tokens, it became easier to determine how to process input, such as deciding between built-in functionality and external program execution.

---

**Step 2: Run External Commands with Process Groups**  
Next, I used `fork` and `execve` to launch external programs in child processes. Setting a new process group ID prevented terminal signals from impacting the shell itself, and using functions like `dup2` handled file redirection reliably (for example, `> output.txt` or `< input.txt`).

---

**Step 3: Manage Concurrency and Signals**  
A major highlight was concurrency management. By blocking signals (`SIGCHLD`, `SIGINT`, `SIGTSTP`) at critical moments, I avoided race conditions when updating shared data structures, such as the job list. Handling `SIGCHLD` ensured child processes were properly reaped (avoiding zombies), and forwarding `SIGINT`/`SIGTSTP` to the foreground job mirrored how typical shells behave with Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z.

---

**Step 4: Conclusion and Key Takeaways**  
Building this shell showed me how to write clean, modular code under real system constraints—concurrency, synchronization, and signal handling. It also gave me hands-on experience debugging complex interactions between multiple processes. Ultimately, the Shell Lab taught me to architect solutions that handle asynchronous events gracefully, which is a valuable skill for any software engineering role.
