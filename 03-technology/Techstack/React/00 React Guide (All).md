## 2. React State Management & Hooks

- **Fundamental Hooks:**
    
    - **useState:** Manages local state in functional components.
        
        - _Problem:_ Replaces the older class-based `this.state` and `setState` with a functional paradigm.
            
    - **useEffect:** Handles side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM changes.
        
        - _Problem:_ Effectively replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
            
- **Advanced Hooks:**
    
    - **useContext:** Provides a way to share state (or global data) without prop drilling.
        
        - _Problem:_ Simplifies accessing and managing global or shared data.
            
    - **useMemo and useCallback:**
        
        - _Problem:_ Optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations and functions, thus reducing unnecessary re-renders.
            
    - **useRef:**
        
        - _Problem:_ Manage references to DOM elements and persist mutable values without triggering re-renders.
            
    - **Custom Hooks:**
        
        - _What:_ Encapsulate and reuse complex or common logic.

- **Forwarding Refs & Memo:**
    
    - **React.forwardRef:** Allows passing refs to child components.
        
        - _Problem:_ Useful for accessing DOM elements in wrapped components.
            
    - **React.memo:** Wraps functional components to avoid re-renders when props remain unchanged.
        
        - _Problem:_ Enhances performance in high-frequency update scenarios.
