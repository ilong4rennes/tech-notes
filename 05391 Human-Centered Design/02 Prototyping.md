# Low-Fi Prototyping
## Why Prototype?

- Prototype - evaluate - iterate cycle 
- Don’t want to program for weeks or months before feedback

## Interface Storyboards

- Interface storyboard shows detail and flow 
- How does the app / software / hardware work 
- What actions can users perform and what are the consequences

## “Wizard of Oz” 

- A human ‘wizard’ interprets user input and simulates a system response. 
- Allows rapid testing of complex features before its implementation

## An Ideal Design Process 

- Do as many low-fi iterations rapidly in early stages of design to work out bugs 
- Fail fast, try lots of ideas, breadth 
- Avoid medium and high-fidelity tools until later 
- Over time, progressively refine your design, adding details (icons, colors, logos, etc.) 
- Cost vs. fidelity tradeoff 
- Transition to med-fi and/or high-fi

## Paper prototypes

- Benefits: Quick, Inexpensive, Fast iterations, No implementation
- Limitations: Limited functionality, Limited look and feel, Only supervised testing, Can’t show to clients

# MidFi and Interactive Prototyping

## Tools

- Figma, Miro, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, InVision  

## Ideation approach

- An idea is the output of the innovation process, not the starting point.
- Making ideation … the starting point of the innovation process, although common, turns innovation into a guessing game. It is the most inefficient approach to innovation… Why? Because it is nearly impossible to have a big idea before knowing what customer, job-to-be-done, … unmet needs, and price the idea has to address.
- **The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.**
- Basic Process:
	- Ideate individually first
	- Bring ideas to group, share, brainstorm more
	- Generate ideas in parallel, not serially
	- Don’t get locked into ideas early
	- Don’t shut down other peoples ideas (you don’t know what they might lead to)
	- Prototype* to get feel for idea and determine if it is worth pursing

## Functional Fixation

- A cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used.
