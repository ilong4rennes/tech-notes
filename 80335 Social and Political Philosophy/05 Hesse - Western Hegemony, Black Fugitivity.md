### Introduction
- The essay examines Isaiah Berlin’s **“Two Concepts of Liberty”** in the context of **Black fugitive thought**.
  - Key figures in Black fugitive thought include **Aimé Césaire**, **W. E. B. Du Bois**, and **David Walker**.
  - Argues that Western political theory, particularly liberty, excludes its links to **colonialism and slavery**.
  - The essay characterizes this exclusion as **colonial-racial foreclosure**, where certain references become impossible to formulate in discourse.

### Colonial-Racial Foreclosure
- **Foreclosure** refers to the preemptive exclusion of certain concepts or references from discourse, making them unspeakable.
  - This concept is derived from **Lacanian psychoanalysis**.
  - Foreclosure plays a role in Western liberal thought by excluding **colonialism and racial oppression** from discussions about liberty.
- **Isaiah Berlin’s “Two Concepts of Liberty”**:
  - Defines **negative liberty** as freedom from interference.
  - Defines **positive liberty** as self-mastery, but argues it can lead to tyranny.
  - Berlin's framing ignores colonial and racial implications, focusing only on Cold War binaries between Western democracy and communism.

### Black Political Thought vs. Western Liberalism
- Black political thought challenges the **Western hegemony** of liberty.
  - Thinkers like **Césaire** and **Du Bois** argue that Western ideas of freedom were built on the exclusion and oppression of non-white peoples.
- **Césaire’s critique**:
  - Examines Western **liberalism** and its links to **colonial violence** and **racism**.
  - Highlights how Western freedom was achieved through the domination of colonized peoples.
- **David Walker’s Appeal**:
  - Walker critiques both the **institution of slavery** and the racial limits placed on freedom for Black people in the U.S.
  - His analysis connects **liberty** to a global, anti-slavery perspective, arguing that the freedom of Black people was inseparable from freedom for all.

### The Limits of Berlin’s Liberty
- **Negative liberty** in Berlin’s framework is tied to **non-interference**, but does not account for the systemic interference of **colonialism** and **racism**.
  - Berlin’s concept of freedom ignores the realities of **anti-colonialism** and **anti-racism**, focusing instead on individualistic notions of liberty.
- Western political theory’s focus on liberty has consistently avoided addressing the **legacies of colonialism**.

### The Third Concept of Liberty
- **Republican liberty** emphasizes **non-domination**, as opposed to non-interference (negative liberty).
  - This concept is related to **Roman legal thought** and republicanism, emphasizing the absence of domination, rather than simply avoiding interference.
  - However, even this formulation of liberty fails to fully engage with the **racial legacies** of slavery and colonialism.

### Conclusion
- **Black fugitive thought** challenges the **foreclosures** of Western liberalism.
  - Figures like **Du Bois** and **Césaire** use their works to expose the **racialized exclusions** that underpin Western concepts of freedom.
  - These thinkers engage in a form of **escapology**, seeking to escape the conceptual confines of Western political thought and offer alternative understandings of liberty.
